NYU Campus Dish Scraper
===

Following [Michael Strickland](https://github.com/abstrctn/)'s lead and open
sourcing some scrapers. This scraper parses NYU's dining menus. Unfortunately
Hayden + Weinstein are broken at this time. It can not be scraped since their
urls do not work.


The scraper currently prints out a JSON feed, but you are free to manipulate it
to your needs.
